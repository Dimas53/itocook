# ItoCook — Roadmap

> This file is the big picture of the project. Small steps are in `docs/progress.md`.
> Agent reads this file at the start of each session to understand the context and not dive into details of the wrong phase.

---

## Phase 1: UI Skeleton ✅ 2026-06-02
**Goal:** can open the app, navigate through screens, see the final layout of all screens. No real data — only UI.

### M1: UI Foundation & Design System ✅
- [x] Design system — tokens, fonts, Tailwind config
- [x] iPhone frame layout (`layouts/default.vue`), Dynamic Island
- [x] Onboarding screen — flex layout, TypeScript
- [x] Auth screen — basic layout
- [x] Tailwind config full sync — all 13 tokens
- [x] Nuxt config — main.css connected

### M2: Layout & Global Navigation ✅
- [x] `components/` directory created
- [x] `BottomTabBar.vue` — 5 tabs, Phosphor icons, active/inactive
- [x] Tab bar integrated in `default.vue`, hidden on `/onboarding` and `/auth`

### M3: Core Authentication Flow ✅
- [x] auth.vue — form, validation, errors, loading state
- [x] Fake login (hardcoded user)
- [x] Redirect after login to Home
- [x] `darkStatus` — uncomment `invert` in layout
- [x] Route protection — redirect to `/auth` if not logged in

---

## Phase 2: First Live Flow ✅ 2026-06-03
**Goal:** Login works with a real backend, token is saved, basic user session is pulled from Directus.

- [x] Set up Directus SDK / HTTP client as composable (`useDirectus`)
- [x] Rewrite `useAuth` — send real POST to Directus `/auth/login` and save token in cookies
- [x] Set up global middleware to check live token via Directus (request to `/users/me`)
- [x] Display on the main page (`index.vue`) the first real data from Directus: name, email
- [x] Registration — via server proxy (admin API), User role is assigned
- [x] Set up dynamic redirect after login: if user is today's cook → Cook page, otherwise → Home

---

## Phase 3: Directus Schema Setup ✅ 2026-06-03
**Goal:** create all collections via Directus MCP before starting screen layout. Schema-first approach.

- [x] `cook_queue` collection (fields: date, cook user relation, dish name, status, category)
- [x] `orders` collection (fields: user relation, cook_queue relation, status)
- [x] `order_items` collection (fields: order relation, quantity)
- [x] `transactions` collection (fields: user relation, amount, type, description, date)
- [x] `balances` collection (fields: user relation, amount)
- [x] `recipes` collection (fields: dish_name, category, description, ingredients, steps, photo, pasta_packages, forked_from)
- [x] `app_settings` singleton (fields: pasta_package_price)
- [x] `recipe_likes` collection (fields: recipe, user)

---

## Phase 4: Feature Screens 🟡 (in progress)
**Goal:** Final layout of all app screens according to the current screen map.
Each screen is adapted to the real data structure from Directus.
Agent reads `docs/design.md` before laying out each screen.

---

### Navigation (Bottom Tab Bar) ✅
- [x] Tab 1 — Home: icon `ph:cooking-pot`
- [x] Tab 2 — Kitchen: icon `ph:calendar-blank`
- [x] Tab 3 — AI Recipe: icon `ph:sparkle` (Admin → `ph:chart-bar` → Finance Page)
- [x] Tab 4 — Duty: icon `ph:broom`
- [x] Tab 5 — Common: icon `ph:users`
- [x] Tab replacement logic when Admin/Accountant logs in

### Billing / Balance Tasks
- [x] **Task A'** — "Lunch is ready" decoupled from cost entry; receipt form in 'ready' state; overdue badge after 14:00
- [x] **Task C** — Cook cancels entire cook_queue entry; all orders deleted; no transactions touched
- [x] **Task E** — Admin Finances page: balances overview, manual top-up, transaction history, pasta price setting
- [x] **Task F** — Recipe pasta_packages field + app_settings singleton + useMealCost composable; pasta cost in deduction
- [ ] **Task B'** — Reminder for overdue cost entry; auto-expire of stale cook_queue entries → **deferred to Phase 6 (Notifications)**
- [ ] **Task D** — Ghost participants / leave-join logic with <10h/<1h thresholds; cook approval flow → **deferred to Phase 6 (Notifications)**
- [ ] **Task G** — Recipe estimated_price field (optional, non-blocking) → **deferred, low priority**

---

## Phase 5: Remaining Feature Screens 🟡
**Goal:** Complete all tab screens, add shopping list export, finish Profile balance view.

- [x] **Share shopping list** — done via Recipe Detail bottom sheet (share icon → 3 actions: add to list, copy, share)
- [x] **Profile balance + transaction history** — done: balance block + collapsible transaction history
- [x] **Recipe Detail — cooking steps** — done: steps rendered below ingredients
- [ ] **AI Recipe screen** — chat UI, JSON recipe render with emoji ingredients, "Add to recipes" / "Share list" buttons
- [ ] **Duty screen** — auto-assignment + notifications (calendar + confirm + admin edit already done in Phase 4)
- [ ] **Common screen** — announcements feed, pool collections with progress bars

---

## Phase 6: In-App Notifications 🟡
**Goal:** business logic notifications work automatically; ghost-participant billing logic added.
No FastAPI, no email — only Directus Flows + `notifications` collection + Nuxt UI.

- [x] **Step 0–1:** `notifications` collection + 4 Directus Flows (Cook Assigned, Lunch Ready, Balance Low, Morning Reminder) + 1 Utility Flow
  - ✅ All 4 business flows + Utility flow fixed and tested (2026-06-22)
  - **Fixes applied:** `$trigger.key` → `$trigger.keys[0]`, `$trigger.body.*` → `$trigger.*` (child flow), `item-read` result format (`Array.isArray` guard), hardcoded user UUID → real user from fetch, Condition `fetch_queue.data._empty` → Run Script with `Array.isArray` guard, redundant operations removed, flow chains reconnected
  - **Code changes:** `&filter[user][_eq]=$CURRENT_USER` added to `useNotifications.ts` API call; notification card icon size/semantic colors updated in `notifications.vue`
- [x] **Step 2:** `useNotifications` composable (poll 20s) + `NotificationBell` component (badge, navigation) — installed on all pages
- [x] **Step 3:** `/notifications` page (UI list, skeleton, empty state, card with icon per type, timeAgo, markAsRead, markAllAsRead)
- [x] **Step 4:** Duty reminder Flow — CRON `0 8 * * 1-5`, нотификация `duty_reminder` для не подтвердивших дежурство
- [x] **Step 4b:** Duty Assigned event flow — при создании cleaning_schedule → нотификация назначенному юзеру
- [ ] **Step 5:** Fix cook_queue + orders status choices in Directus schema (add `completed` to cook_queue, add `left_late`/`pending_cook_approval` to orders)
- [ ] **Step 6:** Ghost-participant logic: <10h leave → warning, <1h leave → penalty charge; cook approval for late joins; billable count includes ghost participants
- [ ] **Step 7:** Notification preferences in profile (toggle per type, stored in `directus_users`, checked in Flows)
