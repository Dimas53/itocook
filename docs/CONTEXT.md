## D

### dedup
Deduplication of recipes by `dish_name`. When displaying recipe lists, only the latest fork or original is shown per dish name. Implemented in `utils/dedupRecipes.ts`.

- **Files:** `frontend/app/utils/dedupRecipes.ts`, `frontend/app/pages/index.vue:197`, `frontend/app/pages/kitchen.vue:395`, `frontend/app/pages/cook.vue:652`, `frontend/app/pages/recipes.vue:85`
- **Related:** Fork, Recipe
- **Docs:** [recipe-system.md](architecture/recipe-system.md)

### Deduction
The process of splitting a meal's total cost (receipt amount + optional pasta add-on) among all participants and updating each user's balance. Implemented in `useDeduction` composable with server-side admin-proxy for security. Each participant gets a transaction for their share.

- **Files:** `frontend/app/composables/useDeduction.ts`, `frontend/app/pages/cook.vue` (ready/done states), `frontend/server/api/deduction/confirm.post.ts`
- **Related:** confirmDeduction, Transaction, Balance, Receipt, Pasta Package
- **Docs:** [finance.md](architecture/finance.md)

### Dish
What the cook is preparing on a given day. Stored as `dish_name` on a `cook_queue` entry. May or may not have a linked `recipe`. A dish becomes a Recipe only when saved via create/edit flow.

- **Files:** `frontend/app/pages/cook.vue` (dish state), `frontend/app/components/HeroBlock.vue`, `frontend/app/pages/kitchen.vue`
- **Collections:** `cook_queue` → field `dish_name`

Admin-only page at `/finance` (replaces AI Recipe tab for finance role users). Shows all user balances with color coding, manual top-up form, transaction history, and pasta package price editor.

- **Files:** `frontend/app/pages/finance.vue`, `frontend/app/components/BalanceRow.vue`, `frontend/app/components/TransactionRow.vue`
- **Related:** Balance, Transaction, isFinanceRole
- **Docs:** [finance.md](architecture/finance.md)

### Fork
A pattern where a user cooks another user's recipe: the system creates a copy of the original recipe owned by the current cook. The copy has `forked_from` pointing to the original recipe ID. On repeat cooking, the existing fork is reused instead of creating another copy.

- **Files:** `frontend/app/pages/cook.vue:762-795`, `frontend/app/pages/profile.vue` (My Recipes)
- **Collections:** `recipes` → field `forked_from`
- **Related:** Recipe, Cook (person), Cook (field)
- **Docs:** [recipe-system.md](architecture/recipe-system.md)

---

## G

### Ghost Participant
A user who has joined a meal (has a `confirmed` order) but did not cancel before the 1-hour cutoff or did not show up. The billing logic still deducts their share because the cost was already split. Not yet implemented; deferred to Phase 6 (Task D). Future logic: <1h leave triggers penalty charge, cook must approve late joins.

- **Files:** `docs/roadmap.md` (Task D), `docs/progress.md`
- **Related:** Order, Participant, Deduction, Balance Gate

---

## H

### HeroBlock
The "Who's cooking today?" UI component used on Home (`index.vue`) and Kitchen (`kitchen.vue`) pages. Has 3 visual states: **loading** (skeleton), **cook** (dish name, category image, cook avatar, status, participant count), **empty** (CTA to become cook). Also shows fallback `chef-cook.png` when queue entry has no linked recipe.

- **Files:** `frontend/app/components/HeroBlock.vue`, `frontend/app/pages/index.vue`, `frontend/app/pages/kitchen.vue`
- **Related:** Cook (person), cook_queue
- **Docs:** [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)

---

## I

### isFinanceRole
A computed boolean that checks if the current user's role UUID matches the finance/accountant role. Controls whether the BottomTabBar shows the Finance tab (instead of AI Recipe). Role UUID is hardcoded in `BottomTabBar.vue`.

- **Files:** `frontend/app/components/BottomTabBar.vue`
- **Related:** BottomTabBar, Finance Page

---

## M

### MonthCalendar
Reusable component extracted from `duty.vue`. Renders a grid of weekday cells (Mon-Fri) with state indicators (today, has entry, current user, confirmed, past). Supports prev/next month navigation. Also reused in `recipe/[id].vue` for the date picker bottom-sheet.

- **Files:** `frontend/app/components/MonthCalendar.vue`, `frontend/app/pages/duty.vue`, `frontend/app/pages/recipe/[id].vue`
- **Related:** Duty, cleaning_schedule
- **Docs:** [duty.md](architecture/duty.md)

---

## N

### navigateFallback
A Workbox option that intercepts ALL navigation requests. In this project it is deliberately set to `null` to prevent Directus `/cms/` routes from being hijacked by the Service Worker. Without this fix, the SW intercepts navigation to Directus admin and returns HTML instead of JS/CSS, causing MIME type errors.

- **Files:** `frontend/nuxt.config.ts` (workbox config)
- **Related:** Service Worker, PWA
- **Docs:** [notifications.md](architecture/notifications.md)

### Nightly Cleanup Flow
A Directus CRON Flow (`0 3 * * *`) that deletes `notifications` records older than 7 days. Runs daily at 3:00 AM. Chain: `calc_cutoff` (exec) → `fetch_old` (item-read) → `extract_ids` (exec) → `delete_old` (item-delete). Created during Phase 6b (2026-06-27).

- **Files:** Directus Flows → "Nightly Notification Cleanup"
- **Collections:** `notifications`
- **Related:** Notification, useNotifications
- **Docs:** [notifications.md](architecture/notifications.md)

---

## O

### Order
A record in the `orders` collection representing a user's commitment to participate in a meal. NOT a restaurant order — it's a join/leave record. Fields: `user` (M2O), `cook_queue` (M2O), `status` (confirmed). The cook auto-gets an order when assigned as cook.

- **Files:** `frontend/app/composables/useParticipants.ts`, `frontend/app/pages/recipe/[id].vue` (Join button), `frontend/app/pages/profile.vue` (My List)
- **Collections:** `orders`
- **Related:** Participant, cook_queue, Ghost Participant
- **Docs:** [cook-queue.md](architecture/cook-queue.md)

---

## P

### Participant
A user who has joined a meal via a `confirmed` `orders` entry. The participant list drives cost splitting in deduction and shows in cook panel, recipe detail, and hero block.

- **Files:** `frontend/app/composables/useParticipants.ts`, `frontend/app/pages/cook.vue` (participants section), `frontend/app/pages/recipe/[id].vue`
- **Collections:** `orders` (filtered by `status: confirmed` and `cook_queue`)
- **Related:** Order, Deduction, Balance Gate
- **Docs:** [cook-queue.md](architecture/cook-queue.md)

### push_subscription
A browser's Web Push subscription object (endpoint + keys) stored in the Directus `push_subscriptions` collection. Created when the user grants notification permission on first login. Contains `endpoint`, `p256dh`, `auth`, and `user` (M2O to directus_users). Used by FastAPI `/send-push` to deliver push notifications.

- **Files:** `frontend/app/composables/usePushNotifications.ts`, `frontend/server/api/push/vapid-key.get.ts`, `api/app/main.py`
- **Collections:** `push_subscriptions`
- **Related:** PWA, Service Worker, VAPID
- **Docs:** [notifications.md](architecture/notifications.md)

### push_subscription dedup
On re-login, `usePushNotifications.subscribe()` checks for an existing endpoint in Directus (`GET /items/push_subscriptions?filter[endpoint][_eq]=...`) before creating a new record. This avoids duplicate push subscriptions per user, which would cause duplicate push notifications (one per subscription record).

- **Files:** `frontend/app/composables/usePushNotifications.ts:52-70`
- **Collections:** `push_subscriptions` (read permission required for dedup check)
- **Related:** push_subscription, usePushNotifications
- **Docs:** [notifications.md](architecture/notifications.md)

### PWA (Progressive Web App)
ItoCook installed as a standalone app on iPhone via "Add to Home Screen". Required for Web Push on iOS (Safari browser tab does not support push). Implemented via `@vite-pwa/nuxt` with `generateSW` strategy. Manifest has `display: standalone`, 192x192 and 512x512 icons.

- **Files:** `frontend/nuxt.config.ts` (pwa config), `frontend/app/public/icons/`
- **Related:** Service Worker, push_subscription, VAPID, generateSW
- **Docs:** [notifications.md](architecture/notifications.md)

### Pasta Package
An integer field on `recipes` (`pasta_packages`) that tracks how many packages of pasta were used. Also can be derived from ingredients array (entry with name "pasta"). The cost is computed as `packages × pasta_package_price` (from `app_settings`). Shown as a separate line in receipt preview.

- **Files:** `frontend/app/composables/useDeduction.ts` (`loadPastaCost`), `frontend/app/composables/useMealCost.ts`, `frontend/app/components/ReceiptSummary.vue`, `frontend/app/pages/recipe/create.vue`
- **Collections:** `recipes` → field `pasta_packages`, `app_settings` → field `pasta_package_price`
- **Related:** Deduction, app_settings
- **Docs:** [finance.md](architecture/finance.md)

---

## R

### Receipt
The total cost of ingredients for a meal, entered by the cook in the `ready` state. A number in euros. Combined with pasta cost to form the grand total, then split equally among participants. Not stored as a file upload yet (planned for Phase 7).

- **Files:** `frontend/app/pages/cook.vue:340-351` (receipt input), `frontend/app/components/ReceiptSummary.vue`
- **Related:** Deduction, confirmDeduction, Pasta Package
- **Docs:** [finance.md](architecture/finance.md)

### Recipe
A reusable dish definition stored in the `recipes` collection. Fields: `dish_name`, `category`, `description`, `ingredients` (JSON array), `steps` (JSON array), `photo` (file UUID), `pasta_packages`, `servings`, `forked_from`. Distinguished from "Dish" — a recipe is a saved template; a dish is what the cook prepares on a given day.

- **Files:** `frontend/app/pages/recipe/[id].vue`, `frontend/app/pages/recipe/create.vue`, `frontend/app/pages/recipes.vue`, `frontend/app/pages/cook.vue`, `frontend/app/pages/index.vue`, `frontend/app/pages/kitchen.vue`, `frontend/app/composables/useRecipeImage.ts`
- **Collections:** `recipes`, `recipe_likes`
- **Related:** Dish, Fork, Pasta Package, Cook (field)
- **Docs:** [recipe-system.md](architecture/recipe-system.md)

### recipe_likes
Junction collection tracking which users liked which recipes. Used for like counts on recipe cards and heart toggle on recipe detail. Fields: `recipe` (M2O to recipes), `user` (M2O to directus_users).

- **Files:** `frontend/app/pages/recipe/[id].vue`, `frontend/app/pages/index.vue`, `frontend/app/pages/kitchen.vue`, `frontend/app/pages/recipes.vue`
- **Collections:** `recipe_likes`

- **Docs:** [recipe-system.md](architecture/recipe-system.md)

---

## S

### shopping_list_items
Collection for per-user shopping list entries. Fields: `user` (M2O), `recipe` (M2O), `recipe_name`, `ingredient_name`, `amount`, `unit`, `emoji`, `is_checked`, `sort`, `cook_date`. Items are auto-deleted on deduction or cancel cooking.

- **Files:** `frontend/app/pages/shopping-list.vue`, `frontend/app/components/ShoppingListWidget.vue`, `frontend/app/composables/useDeduction.ts` (`cleanupShoppingList`), `frontend/app/pages/cook.vue` (`cancelCooking`)
- **Collections:** `shopping_list_items`
- **Related:** Order, Deduction
- **Docs:** [shopping-list.md](architecture/shopping-list.md)

### Service Worker
A background script (`/sw.js`) generated by `@vite-pwa/nuxt` using the `generateSW` strategy. Intercepts `push` events and calls `push-handler.js` (via `importScripts`) to show system notifications. Also handles `notificationclick` events — focuses an existing window or opens a new one, then navigates to the URL from the notification payload. Scope is `/` which means it intercepts all navigation requests (hence `navigateFallback: null` is critical).

- **Files:** `frontend/app/public/push-handler.js`, `frontend/nuxt.config.ts` (workbox pwa config)
- **Related:** PWA, push_subscription, navigateFallback, generateSW
- **Docs:** [notifications.md](architecture/notifications.md)

### generateSW
The Workbox strategy used in `nuxt.config.ts` PWA config. Auto-generates `sw.js` at build time from a minimal set of configuration options (runtime caching, import scripts). Alternative to `injectManifest`, which requires a custom `sw.js` source file. `generateSW` was chosen here because `injectManifest` caused a build conflict in Nuxt 4's `app/public/` directory where `swSrc` and `swDest` resolved to the same file.

- **Files:** `frontend/nuxt.config.ts` (pwa.workbox config)
- **Related:** Service Worker, PWA, navigateFallback
- **Docs:** [notifications.md](architecture/notifications.md)

### State Machine
The cook_queue lifecycle implemented as a computed `state` in `cook.vue:579-587`. States: `loading` → `assign` → `dish` → `scheduled` → `cooking` → `ready` → `done`. Each state renders a distinct UI section. Transitions are triggered by user actions (assignAsCook, saveDish, startCooking, markReady, confirmDeduction).

- **Files:** `frontend/app/pages/cook.vue:579-599` (state computed + pageTitle)
- **Related:** Cook Panel, cook_queue, confirmDeduction
- **Docs:** [cook-queue.md](architecture/cook-queue.md)

- **Files:** `frontend/app/composables/useParticipantsModal.ts`, `frontend/app/layouts/app.vue`
- **Related:** Participant, useParticipants

### Server Proxy
A Nuxt server route (in `frontend/server/`) that proxies admin-privileged requests from the browser to Directus without exposing admin credentials. Examples: `POST /api/auth/signup`, `POST /api/deduction/confirm`, `PATCH /api/duty/upsert`. Uses cached admin token via `getAdminToken()` utility.

- **Files:** `frontend/server/api/auth/signup.post.ts`, `frontend/server/api/deduction/confirm.post.ts`, `frontend/server/api/duty/confirm.post.ts`, `frontend/server/api/duty/upsert.post.ts`, `frontend/server/utils/adminToken.ts`, `frontend/server/utils/auth.ts`
